A specialized custom Language Learning Model (LLM) knowledge base was meticulously developed to answer yoga-related questions. This innovative solution leverages entirely free, open-source APIs and frameworks, ensuring cost-effectiveness and accessibility. The knowledge base generates answers exclusively from a curated collection of yoga textbooks that have been meticulously inputted into the system, ensuring that the information is both accurate and authoritative.

This solution employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, which enhances the quality and relevance of the responses by integrating a retrieval mechanism with the generative model. Qdrantâ€™s free tier was utilized to store and manage all yoga-related data efficiently, providing a robust and scalable vector database.

For generating the answers, the Hugging Face free Inference API was used, which offers advanced natural language processing capabilities to deliver precise and contextually appropriate responses. The user interface was designed using Streamlit, a powerful framework for creating interactive web applications, ensuring that the information is presented in a clear, accessible, and user-friendly manner.

Overall, this comprehensive solution integrates advanced machine-learning techniques with high-quality data sources and user-friendly presentation tools to provide a reliable and efficient platform for addressing yoga-related inquiries.
